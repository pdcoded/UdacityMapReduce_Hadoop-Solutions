For store purchase problem, I have used tab as delimiter.
1)select item,sum(cost) from store_purchase group by item order by item;
2)select storename,max(cost) from store_purchase group by storename order by storename;
3)select count(*),sum(cost) from store_purchase;
##For access_log problem, I have used space as delimiter
4)select col_6,count(*) from access_log where col_6='/assets/js/the-associates.js' group by col_6;
5)select col_0,count(*) from access_log where col_0='10.99.99.186' group by col_0;
6)select col_0,count(*) as cnt from access_log2 group by col_0 order by cnt desc limit 1;
(Run the querry 6 not on the original access_log file but after cleaning the access_log file with mapper6.py code.
Mapper6.py removes all discrepencies in the path as described in the problem set)

All the problems are solved using BeesWax(Hive UI) in HUE.It runs Mapreduce algorithm on HQL which is way too fast.
